|Redux

|__Types.js
|__Actions.js
|__Store.js
|__Reducers
   |__Posts.js

## Use It AnyWhere `I Use It In App.js`

## I Prefer Put It In Main `index.js` To Become General For All Application Or How You Want

### Add More Of Reducers In Reducers Folder But The Types And Actions Add It To It's Files

### Here We Can Use `More Than One Reducer` , `Redux-Thunk` And `REDUX-DEV-TOOLS`
